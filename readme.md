# Express Movies API

This repo contains a basic API that handles CRUD functions for a movies dataset. It's based on **Node** and **Express** and uses **Typescript** with tests written in **Jest**. For the purposes of this exercise, we're not connecting to any database; data is contained in `/data`.

```
Movie
  id
  title
  year
  director
  genre
  stars
```

## Setup

`npm install`

## Running locally

`npm run dev`

It runs at `localhost:5002/movies`


## Testing

`npm run test`

## Activity

The contents of branch `/add-ratings` contain changes to add a rating functionality to each movie. These changes contain many mistakes.
